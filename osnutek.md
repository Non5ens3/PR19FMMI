Project for data mining

Traffic in Slovenia

The goal of our project is analysis of traffic data in Slovenia to find out if there is an impact on the population and environment.

We are going to try to answer the following questions:

What is the correlation between car accidents and alcohol abuse,

What is the correlation between fining and the reoccurrence of violation of given sort,

Which age group is more prone to commit more accidents (young vs old),

How the number increase of personal vehicles influences the environment,

The trend of obtaining drivers licence, whether people get it sooner or later in life,

How much a person needs to spend in order to keep driving (monthly/yearly car gas bills, reapirement cost, licensing cost..),

Safety of driving a car, compared to other means of transport.
